      <h1>The Mystical World of Mushrooms</h1>
      <p>Mushrooms are incredible little organisms that populate the dark shadowy spots of the world's woods and forests. Few types of plants are so inriguing, and each type has their own sort of style, flavor, and personality; just like people. It makes sense that they are genetically closer to humans than other types of plants. Let's go exploring in our little forest here and see what kinds of mushrooms we can find...</p>
