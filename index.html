      <h1>The Mystical World of Mushrooms</h1>
      <p>Mushrooms are incredible little organisms that populate the dark shadowy spots of the world's woods and forests. Few types of plants are so inriguing, and each type has their own sort of style, flavor, and personality; just like people. It makes sense that they are genetically closer to humans than other types of plants. Let's go exploring in our little forest here and see what kinds of mushrooms we can find...</p>

          <p>No, they're not; in fact these are Morel mushrooms! They are an edible muchroom, coveted for their deep meaty taste. They are best sauted in butter.</p>

          <img src="img/fly.jpg" alt="Fly Agaric mushrooms" width="200px">
          <p>Whoa! Be careful, those are fly agaric mushrooms, also known as amanita muscaria. They can only be eaten after special preparations, and if eaten without those they are extremely poisonous. A good rule of thumb: don't eat mushrooms you picked yourself unless you're sure what they are!</p>

          <p>Those aren't bean sprouts silly! Those are a type of mushroom called enoki, commonly used in Asian cooking. They are much more flavorful than beansprouts and much more versatile in the kitchen.</p>
